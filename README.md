Implement a beat detection algorithm (provided) that will try to identify pulses in music.
Use the beat detection algorithm to change the LED's color in some manner.
Automatically switch to DMX whenever valid DMX data starts coming in.
Switch back to sound mode (or auto mode) when you haven't seen any DMX data for a while (say, 2-5 seconds).
